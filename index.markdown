Welcome to the CMSIS SVD community project, dedicated to providing Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools and easily accessible SVD collections for ARM Cortex-M and other microcontrollers.

## Objectives

Our community aims to make SVD (System View Description) files and related tools freely available and easily accessible, fostering development and innovation in embedded systems.

## What We Provide

- **[SVD Data Collections](https://github.com/cmsis-svd/cmsis-svd-data)**: Comprehensive aggregations of ARM Cortex-M and other CMSIS SVD files for various devices.

- **[SVD Parsers and Tools](https://github.com/cmsis-svd/cmsis-svd)**: Python-based tools for parsing, validating, and working with SVD files.
