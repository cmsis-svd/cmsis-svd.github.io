Hey there!

In the past months we have been shaping CMSIS-SVD to welcome new volunteers and to make collaboration easier.

The project is undergoing a mild reorganization where roles, communications, and maintenance workflows are being aligned so everyone can contribute smoothly, even when some of us only have small amounts of time to spend.

As part of this reorganization, there are already some published changes!

We now have a website with a landing page explaining what the objectives of the project and the most important content locations.
This new website is now the home of the news section you are reading.
Although this is only the first post, going forward you'll find changes, updates, or announcements the project needs to share in this section.

Finally, CMSIS-SVD schema definitions have been moved into their own repository at <https://github.com/cmsis-svd/svd-schema> so they are easier to access, maintain and reuse by different tools.

Slowly, things are taking shape!
